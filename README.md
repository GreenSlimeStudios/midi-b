### Midi-b
This program aims to visualise the notes played on a midi device like a piano in a nice visual way that is very customizable.
it is the successor of my older version [midi-recorder](https://github.com/GreenSlimeStudios/midi-recorder/tree/main) that is built from the ground up to have better performance and more functionality.

It has a preview keyboard at the bottom indicating what keys are being pressed that updates its look on key presses. You can change the height of it and the colors on idle and on pressed individually for white and black keys.
You can limit the range of keys if you are using a smaller keyboard or a midi controller in the settings.

To run the program clone the repo and run `cargo run --release`, then simply choose the correct midi input from the terminal window if you have multiple otherwise it should connect automaticly. If you have any problems run `cargo run --release d` and it should should print out the incoming midi messages, if it doesnt then check your midi connection.

I am also working on adding support to reading midi files and displaying them soon to be implemented in the main program.

the program also allows for some wild color combinations and bloom effects that make it look magical
